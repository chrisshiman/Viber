# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project:** Task Manager App
**Owner:** \[You / Your Team]
**Date:** \[Insert Date]

---

## 1. Overview

The Task Manager is a lightweight, single-user web application for personal productivity. It enables users to create, update, delete, and organize tasks without requiring authentication or a backend. All data is stored locally in the browser (LocalStorage or IndexedDB).

The application emphasizes **simplicity**, **speed**, and **modern UI design** using **Next.js, TypeScript (strict mode), and Material UI (MUI)**, deployed on **Vercel** for seamless hosting.

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

* Provide a clean and intuitive interface for managing tasks.
* Enable offline-first functionality by storing all data locally.
* Offer fast performance with zero backend requirements.
* Support task organization (categories, priority, due dates).
* Deliver a fully responsive experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* Respect user system preferences for light/dark mode, with the ability to override manually.

### Non-Goals

* Multi-user accounts or authentication.
* Cloud synchronization.
* Collaboration/sharing features.
* Advanced project management features (Kanban, Gantt charts).

## 3. User Stories

### Core User Stories

1. As a user, I want to **add a task** with a title, description, due date, and priority so I can manage my workload.
2. As a user, I want to **mark tasks as complete** so I can track my progress.
3. As a user, I want to **edit tasks** so I can update details when things change.
4. As a user, I want to **delete tasks** so I can keep my list clean.
5. As a user, I want my tasks to **persist in my browser** so I don’t lose them after refreshing or closing the app.
6. As a user, I want the app to **match my system’s light/dark mode by default**, but I also want to **manually override it** and keep my preference saved.

### Extended User Stories (Nice-to-Have)

7. As a user, I want to **filter tasks** by status (All, Active, Completed).
8. As a user, I want to **sort tasks** by due date, priority, or creation date.
9. As a user, I want to **search tasks** by keyword.
10. As a user, I want to **categorize tasks** (e.g., Work, Personal).
11. As a user, I want to **see task stats** (e.g., completed vs active).

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Core Features (MVP)

* **Task CRUD**: Add, edit, delete, mark complete/incomplete.
* **Persistence**: Store tasks in LocalStorage (or IndexedDB if scaling needed).
* **Task Metadata**: Title (required), Description (optional), Due Date (optional), Priority (Low/Medium/High).
* **Light/Dark Mode**: Detect system preference on first load; allow manual toggle; persist preference locally.
* **Responsive UI**: Mobile-first design with MUI.

### Extended Features (Post-MVP)

* Filtering, sorting, and searching tasks.
* Task categories (labels/tags).
* Task statistics dashboard.
* Export/Import tasks (JSON/CSV).
* PWA support (installable, offline-first).
* Theming support (custom colors, typography).

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance**: Instant interactions (<100ms) and page load <1s.
* **Reliability**: Data persists unless explicitly deleted by user.
* **Usability**: Minimal learning curve with clean UX.
* **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance; high-contrast themes; semantic HTML.
* **Deployment**: Deployed on Vercel with CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 6. Light vs. Dark Mode

* **System Preference Detection**: Respect `prefers-color-scheme` on initial load.
* **Manual Override**: Provide toggle (icon button in header or settings).
* **Persistence**: Save override in LocalStorage.
* **Theming**: Implement using MUI `ThemeProvider` with distinct light and dark themes.
* **Accessibility**: Maintain minimum color contrast ratios; avoid pure black/white to reduce eye strain.

**Success Criteria**

* App loads in dark mode when system is in dark mode.
* User can toggle themes anytime.
* User choice persists across reloads.

---

## 7. Tech Stack

* **Framework**: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript strict mode).
* **UI Library**: Material UI (MUI).
* **State Management**: React hooks & Context API.
* **Storage**: LocalStorage (default) or IndexedDB (for scalability).
* **Deployment**: Vercel.

---

## 8. Success Metrics

* **Adoption**: Users create at least 10 tasks in first week of usage.
* **Retention**: Tasks persist across browser sessions reliably.
* **Engagement**: 70%+ of users interact with theme toggle and filtering after adding >20 tasks.
* **Performance**: Page load under 1s; task actions under 100ms.

---
